## Project: Data Analytics for Automobile Industry.

     The purpose of this project is to use Power BI for data analysis and visualization. 
     The automobile industry dashboard is prepared using Power BI by implementing Extract Load Transform methodology.

                                                                          -- When terminal asks: Is this OK? (yes)    ->Enter yes
                                                            npm install   -- Installs the required modules listed under package.json
                                                            npm start     -- Starts the project on port:   localhost:3000
     5. Open http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.
